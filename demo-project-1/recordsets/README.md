# Recordsets

- [support-notes](support-notes.recordset.json) — dataset definition (columns, types, the
  `Customer.ID` semantic mapping on `CustomerId`) for the `support-notes` collection. The
  actual records live outside this definition, in the inGitDB database at
  [`../data/ingitdb`](../data/ingitdb) (collection `support-notes`), loaded through
  `ingitdb://<path-to-data/ingitdb>`. This file documents the shape; it carries no `files`
  entry because the row data is not duplicated here.
